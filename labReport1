1. Commands with *no* arguments
**`cd`**
![Image](cdNoArg.png)
*Working directory: `/home`
*There is no output becdause `cd` assumes that the argument is the current working directory, `/home`, which it is already in. It does not need to change directories.
*This is not an error.

**`ls`**
![Image](lsNoArg.png)
*Working directory: `/home`
*The command prints out `lecture1` because `ls` functions to list out all files and folders in a directory. It assumes that the argument is the current working directory, so it only prints out 1 folder, which is directy under `/home` in the filesystem.
*This is not an error.

**`cat`**
![Image](catNoArg.png)
*Working directory: `/home`
*The command changes the terminal to be in standard text, instead of allowing the programmer to give commands. Since there is no argument, `cat` assumes that it should print input directly from the terminal. 
*This is not an error.

2. Commands with a path to a *directory* as an argument
**`cd lecture1/messages`**
![Image](cdDirectory.png)
*Working directory: `/home`
*The current working directory changes to `lecture1/messages` because cd follows the path given when both `lecture` and `messages` are folders, and `messages` is listed under `lecture1` in the filesystem.
*This is not an error.

**`ls messages`**
![Image](lsDirectory.png)
*Working directory: `/lecture1`
*The command prints out `en-us.txt  es-mx.txt  ja.txt  zh-cn.txt`, because they are all the files under the `/messages` folder in the filesystem. 
*This is not an error.

**`cat messages`**
![Image](catDirectory.png)
*Working directory: `/lecture1`
*The command prints out the output that messages is a directory, meaning that we need to use a file after cat to print out a file's contents.
*This is an error because cat cannot read the contents of a folder because a folder has no text or code content. It only contains other files in the filesystem.

2. Commands with a path to a *file* as an argument
**`cd lecture1/Hello.java`**
![Image](cdFile.png)
*Working directory: `/home`
*
*This is an error because

**`ls messages/en-us.txt`**
![Image](lsFile.png)
*Working directory: `/lecture1`
*
*This is an error because 

**`cat Hello.java`**
![Image](catFile.png)
*Working directory: `/lecture1`
*
*This is not an error.
