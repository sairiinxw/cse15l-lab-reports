1. Commands with *no* arguments
**`cd`**
![Image](cdNoArg.png)
*Working directory: `/home`
*There is no output becdause `cd` assumes that the argument is the current working directory, `/home`, which it is already in. It does not need to change directories.
*This is not an error.
**`ls`**
![Image](lsNoArg.png)
*Working directory: `/home`
*The command prints out `lecture1` because `ls` functions to list out all files and folders in a directory. It assumes that the argument is the current working directory, so it only prints out 1 folder, which is directy under `/home` in the filesystem.
*This is not an error.
**`cat`**
![Image](catNoArg.png)
*Working directory: `/home`
*The command changes the terminal to be in standard text, instead of allowing the programmer to give commands. Since there is no argument, `cat` assumes that it should print input directly from the terminal. 
*This is not an error.

2. Commands witha path to a *directory* as an argument
**`cd lecture1/messages`**
![Image](cdDirectory.png)
*Working directory: `/home`
*
*This is not an error.
**`ls messages`**
![Image](lsDirectory.png)
*Working directory: `/lecture1`
*
*This is not an error.
**`cat messages`**
![Image](catDirectory.png)
*Working directory: `/lecture1`
*
*This is not an error.
